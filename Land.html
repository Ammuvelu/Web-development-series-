The land is full of grass and flowers.<br>
It reminds me of my childhood, where I played with friends.<br>
It makes my mind calm.<br>
The flowers bloom and spread fragrance, which makes the heart peaceful.<br>
The sound of insects and birds feels like a song.<br>
The sound of the river is like musical instruments.<br>
This short story is about a land where people live like children.
